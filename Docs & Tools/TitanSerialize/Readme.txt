Recomendation:

Use it with GS closed.
Make a backup from DB before use this program.
Use it by your own risk.

Little explanation:

[Serialize] section

SerialToChange is for select the item serial to change example all items with serial 0
ChangeSerials=1 means all items with X serials will get an auto serial
ItemFilterPath means will transform all items with X serial from that list of items (example u can exclude potions in that file, so potions will not change serial)

[Search] section

ItemFilterPath means will search all items from X serial from DB with that filter of items and will displayed and save in logs (will get account and character and position of item)
Serial means search all items with that serial.
